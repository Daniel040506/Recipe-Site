        Description:
        </strong>
        Beef sliders are a small version of a hamburger. A little trick helps you to get them all the same size so they cook evenly and look very professional. 
        <br>Do a couple of tests to determine your perfect degree of doneness and cook all the burgers the same amount of time.

    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, about 1 cup finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li> 
        <li>2 lb lean ground beef</li>
        <li>garlic cloves, minced</li> 
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>6 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>8 hot dog buns</li>
        <li>24 hamburger dill pickle slices (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Finely chop onion and parsley. Combine beef, onion, parsley, garlic and salt in a bowl; mix well. 
            Press beef mixture evenly over bottom of a large bar pan. Bake 10-12 minutes or until beef is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut cheese into quarters; set aside. Slice buns apart neatly at seams (do not separate tops from bottoms). 
            Trim about 1/4 inch from each bun end to square off ends (discard trimmings). cut buns into thirds for a total of 24 square mini buns, set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove bar pan from oven. Pour off juices, if necessary, and place on a cooling rack. 
            Cut beef mixture into 24 squares using a pizza cutter. Top each burger with one pickle and one piece of cheese. 
            Place one bun top onto each burger; top with one bun bottom. Cover bar pan with aluminum foil and bake 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melted and buns are warm.</li>
        <li>To serve, place one burger with bun top onto one bun bottom using a mini spatula. Repeat with remaining burgers and bun bottoms. Serve immediately.</li>
